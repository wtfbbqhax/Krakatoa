# ABuild Configurations

In Krakatoa, the Abuild configurations differ from upstream Alpine for C/C++ Golang and Rust. Where upstream alpine defaults to optimizing for size, we prefer to optimize for _speed_ and debugability.

Krakatoa abuild.conf can be found in [home/build/abuild/abuild.conf](../home/build/abuild/abuild.conf)
